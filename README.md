AniDB-XML-Grabber
=================

Grabs the XML file from AniDB's API on demand, but prevents violation of AniDB API guidelines such as requesting more than once every 24 hours, ultimately to be used for XBMC's AniDB scraper.

Simply place in a web-accessible location with a recent PHP installation and set your AniDB scraper 'Anime list URL' to the URL of wherever you host this script.
